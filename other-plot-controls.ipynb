    "* `ls` - the line style for the contours\n",
    "* `linestyles` - a list of styles to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: `ls` and `linestyles` are mutually exclusive: you should provide neither or one of them, not both!\n",
    "\n",
    "The first 3 arguments are self explanatory, but the others need some explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**levels** controls what contours are plotted. You can specify these in two ways: either give a number (e.g. `levels=10`) or a list.\n",

    "* If you provide a number then this tells Python how many distinct contours you want, and it will choose the values automatically.\n",

    "feel for what the values and shape of the contour are, and then use that\n",
    "to inform which ones you select to plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**colors** controls the colours of the contours. It can either be a\n",
    "single value (e.g. 'black') in which case all contours are that colour;\n",
    "or a list of colours, in which case the contours take their colours from\n",
